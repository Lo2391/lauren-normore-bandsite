        “We push each other to be the best. It’s not uncommon for one of us to
        say ‘this needs to be better, back to the drawing board” <br />

    <h3>The Bees knees</h3>

    <p>
      The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
      California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist Mack
      Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie
      Fischer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned
      act, drawing attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other
      popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow),
      Adams was confident the band could succeed even further, pushing them to
      sign with Magenta Records.
    </p>

    <p>
      From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and
      ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in
      love with the band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying their
      place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this
      century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are
      drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. Looking forward
      to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording their
      second studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.
